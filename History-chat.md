- Developed live preview functionality using react-markdown

### 2. AI Integration
- Integrated multiple AI providers:
  - OpenAI (GPT-5)
  - Google Gemini 2.5 Flash
  - OpenRouter (multiple free models)
- Implemented runtime API key configuration with localStorage persistence
- Created AI assistant component with chat interface
- Added quick action buttons (improve, expand, summarize, correct)
- Implemented streaming and non-streaming AI responses

### 3. MDX Component Support
- Developed custom React components for MDX:
  - Callouts (info, warning, success, default)
  - Counter component
  - Progress bar component
  - Theme box component
  - Footer component
- Implemented proper rendering of MDX components in preview
- Added toolbar integration for component insertion

### 4. UI/UX Enhancements
- Implemented responsive design for all device sizes
- Added dark/light theme support with theme switcher
- Created glassmorphism design elements
- Added smooth animations and transitions
- Developed intuitive toolbar with formatting options
- Implemented content statistics (word/character count)

### 5. Performance Optimizations
- Applied `@next/bundle-analyzer` for bundle size analysis
- Implemented typing detection to prevent preview lag
- Optimized content synchronization between editors
- Added debouncing for rapid typing scenarios
- Implemented efficient state management with React Context

### 6. Error Handling and Validation
- Added comprehensive error handling for AI service calls
- Implemented validation for user inputs
- Created health checks for AI services
- Added proper error messaging in UI
- Implemented fallback mechanisms for service failures

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Editor Synchronization
**Challenge**: Maintaining cursor position and scroll state when updating content programmatically.
**Solution**: Implemented sophisticated state management with refs to track user typing, debounce updates, and preserve cursor positions.

### AI Provider Integration
**Challenge**: Supporting multiple AI providers with different API requirements.
**Solution**: Created a unified service layer with provider-specific configurations and runtime API key handling.

### MDX Component Rendering
**Challenge**: Properly rendering custom React components in Markdown preview.
**Solution**: Developed a custom parsing mechanism to identify and render MDX components within Markdown content.

### Performance with Large Documents
**Challenge**: Maintaining smooth typing experience with large documents.
**Solution**: Implemented typing detection, debouncing, and optimized content updates to prevent UI lag.

## Code Quality and Maintenance

### ESLint Implementation
- Ran comprehensive ESLint analysis
- Fixed all TypeScript errors and warnings
- Enforced code quality standards across the codebase

### Bundle Optimization
- Applied `@next/bundle-analyzer` to identify large dependencies
- Monitored key dependencies:
  - Material UI packages
  - Monaco Editor
  - TipTap Editor
  - AI SDK packages
  - Syntax highlighting libraries

### Project Structure Refinement
- Renamed project from "mdx-editor-01" to "MdxEditorWeb-Qoder"
- Organized components into logical directories (ai, editor)
- Created clear separation of concerns between UI components and business logic

## Runtime Configuration Features

### Dynamic API Key Management
- Implemented runtime API key configuration via UI
- Added localStorage persistence for user preferences
- Created fallback mechanism to environment variables
- Added secure input fields with show/hide functionality
- Implemented event system for key change notifications

### Provider Selection

- Created provider selector component
- Implemented model selection for OpenRouter
- Added provider health checks

## User Experience Improvements

### Intuitive Interface
- Developed clean, modern UI with glassmorphism design
- Created responsive layouts for all screen sizes
- Added visual feedback for all interactive elements
- Implemented smooth transitions between views

### AI Assistant Features
- Designed chat interface with message bubbles
- Added quick action buttons for common operations
- Implemented copy and insert functionality for AI responses
- Created loading states and error handling

### Editor Functionality
- Added comprehensive formatting toolbar
- Implemented content statistics display
- Created multiple editor modes (split, rich, view)
- Added component insertion for MDX editing

## Testing and Validation

### Functionality Testing
- Verified all editor modes work correctly

- Validated input validation

## Deployment Readiness

### Production Build
- Successfully built production version
- Verified all functionality in build
- Confirmed bundle optimization
- Tested deployment process

### Environment Configuration
- Documented required environment variables
- Verified environment fallback mechanisms
- Tested configuration options
- Confirmed security practices

## Future Development Directions

Based on the development process and discussions, potential future enhancements include:

1. **Collaborative Features**: Real-time collaboration and sharing
2. **Advanced Export Options**: Additional format exports (PDF, DOCX)
3. **Extended AI Capabilities**: Image generation, code completion
4. **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible component system
5. **Version History**: Content versioning and rollback capabilities
6. **Enhanced MDX Support**: Additional custom components and features

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Technology Stack**: Chose Next.js with TypeScript for optimal performance and type safety
2. **Editor Libraries**: Selected Monaco Editor and TipTap for complementary editing experiences
3. **UI Framework**: Used Material-UI for consistent, accessible components
4. **AI Integration**: Implemented Vercel AI SDK for provider flexibility
5. **State Management**: Utilized React Context API for simplicity and performance
6. **Styling Approach**: Adopted MUI's sx prop for CSS-in-JS styling
7. **Performance Focus**: Prioritized smooth user experience with typing detection and debouncing
